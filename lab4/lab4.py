    The patch feature for a point is defined as the patch extracted with this point as the center.

    Note that the returned pts is a subset of the input pts.

### Part 2


def get_proposal(pts_cluster, tau_a, X):
    """
    Get the lattice proposal

    Hints:
    (1) As stated in the lab4.pdf, we give priority to points close to each other when we sample a triplet.
        This statement means that we can start from the three closest points and iterate N_a times.
        There is no need to go through every triplet combination.
        For instance, you can iterate over each point. For each point, you choose 2 of the 10 nearest points. The 3 points form a triplet.
        In this case N_a = num_points * 45.

    (2) It is recommended that you reorder the 3 points. 
        Since {a, b, c} are transformed onto {(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1)} respectively, the point a is expected to be the vertex opposite the longest side of the triangle formed by these three points

    (3) Another way of refining the choice of triplet is to keep the triplet whose angle (between the edges <a, b> and <a, c>) is within a certain range.
        The range, for instance, is between 20 degrees and 120 degrees.

    (4) You may find `cv2.getAffineTransform` helpful. However, be careful about the HW and WH ordering when you use this function.

    (5) If two triplets yield the same number of inliers, keep the one with closest 3 points.

    Args:
        pts_cluster: Points within the same cluster.
        tau_a: The threshold of the difference between the transformed corrdinate and integer positions.
               For example, if a point is transformed into (1.1, -2.03), the closest integer position is (1, -2), then the distance is sqrt(0.1^2 + 0.03^2) (for Euclidean distance case).
               If it is smaller than "tau_a", we consider this point as inlier.
        X: When we compute the inliers, we only consider X nearest points to the point "a". 
    Returns:
        proposal: A list of inliers. The first 3 inliers are {a, b, c}. 
                  Each inlier is a dictionary, with key of "pt_int" and "pt" representing the integer positions after affine transformation and orignal coordinates.

def find_texels(img, proposal, texel_size=50):
    """
    Find texels from the given image.

    Hints:
    (1) This function works on RGB image, unlike previous functions such as point detection and clustering that operate on grayscale image.

    (2) You may find `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform` and `cv2.warpPerspective` helpful.
        Please refer to the demo in the notebook for the usage of the 2 functions.
        Be careful about the HW and WH ordering when you use this function.
    
    (3) As stated in the pdf, each texel is defined by 3 or 4 inlier keypoints on the corners.
        If you find this sentence difficult to understand, you can go to check the demo.
        In the demo, a corresponding texel is obtained from 3 points. The 4th point is predicted from the 3 points.

def non_max_suppression(response, suppress_range, threshold=None):
    """
    Non-maximum Suppression for translation symmetry detection

    The general approach for non-maximum suppression is as follows:
        1. Perform thresholding on the input response map. Set the points whose values are less than the threshold as 0.
        2. Find the largest response value in the current response map
        3. Set all points in a certain range around this largest point to 0.

        suppress_range: a tuple of two ints (H_range, W_range). The points around the local maximum point within this range are set as 0. In this case, there are 2*H_range*2*W_range points including the local maxima are set to 0

def template_match(img, proposal, threshold):

def grid2latticeunit(img, proposal, points):
    """
    Convert each lattice grid point into integer lattice grid.

    Hints:
    (1) Since it is difficult to know whether two points should be connected, one way is to map each point into an integer position.
        The integer position should maintain the spatial relationship of these points.
        For instance, if we have three points x1=(50, 50), x2=(70, 50) and x3=(70, 70), we can map them (4, 5), (5, 5) and (5, 6).
        As the distances between (4, 5) and (5, 5), (5, 5) and (5, 6) are both 1, we know that (x1, x2) and (x2, x3) form two edges.
    
    (2) You can use affine transformation to build the mapping above, but do not perform global affine transformation.

    (3) The mapping in the hints above are merely to know whether two points should be connected. 
        If you have your own method for finding the relationship, feel free to implement your owns and ignore the hints above.
